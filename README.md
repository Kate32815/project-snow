PL Research Report Code

We are exploring random access lists in SML for a class project based on:
Standard ML (version 0.93) source code accompanying
	Chris Okasaki
	"Purely Functional Random-Access Lists"
	FPCA '95

For now, to use the added functions, run:

- use "ralist.sig";
- use "ralist.sml";

(Will definitely be updating this/linking the files so it's not as troublesome)
